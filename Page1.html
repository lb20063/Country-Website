<p>The colosseum is one of the most famous parts of Italy. The colosseum used to be known as the Flavian Amphitheater used to entertian people with mostly gladiatorial games but it also preformed dramas and reenactments. It was built as a gift from the Flavian emperors to the Roman people. After a while, the colosseum began to deteriorate and lots of earthquakes damaged it's structure. Two-thirds of the building was destroyed but in the 1990's they began a project to repair the colossum. </p>
