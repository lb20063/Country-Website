        <p>The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a very unique building. It leans because the foundation of the tower had unstable subsoil and the tower has taller columns and arches on the south side compared to the rest. The construction of the Leaning Tower of Pisa began between 1173 and 1399. Some interesting facts are that Pisa has survived through four earthquakes. Also Galileo Galilei used it for his experiments. Reseachers beleive it will not fall for another 200 years.    </p>
